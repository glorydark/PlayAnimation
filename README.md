# PlayAnimation

Player can play **Vanilla Animation** in Nukkit with this plugin! 

Sparked by [iGxnonâ€™s SquareLottery](https://github.com/iGxnon/SquareLottery) and [theBigSmileXD's example](https://github.com/thebigsmileXD/xendevtools2), I added some to make this possible **instead of making players quit again and again and tried to fix a mysterious bug**. And today, it released. Hope it can help more people.

**You can also use it in Nukkit, even if this packet is not implemented.**
