# PlayAnimation

You can play **Vanilla Animation** with this plugin! 

Sparked by iGxnonâ€™s SquareLottery, I added some to make this possible instead of making players quit and tried to fix a mysterious bug. And today, it released. Hope it can help more people.

**You can also use it in Nukkit, even if this packet is not implemented.**

## Command

/playanimation playerName animationName

Example:/playanimation playerName animation.armor_stand.hero_pose
