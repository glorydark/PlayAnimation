# PlayAnimation

You can play **Vanilla Animation** with this plugin! 

Sparked by (iGxnonâ€™s SquareLottery)[https://github.com/iGxnon/SquareLottery] (theBigSmileXD's example)[https://github.com/thebigsmileXD/xendevtools2], I added some to make this possible **instead of making players quit again and again and tried to fix a mysterious bug**. And today, it released. Hope it can help more people.

**You can also use it in Nukkit, even if this packet is not implemented.**

## Command

/playanimation playerName animationName

Example:/playanimation playerName animation.armor_stand.hero_pose
